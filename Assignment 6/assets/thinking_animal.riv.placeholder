# This is a placeholder for the thinking_animal.riv file
# 
# To add a real Rive animation:
# 1. Visit https://rive.app
# 2. Create or download a thinking animal animation
# 3. Export as .riv file
# 4. Replace this file with your .riv file named "thinking_animal.riv"
# 5. Make sure your animation has a state named "idle"
#
# Until then, the app will use the fallback animated emoji
